Ideas:
- Newspaper overview based on API's
- Custom notifications to send out to teammembers or individual users

Research:
- How to get a webpage into teams
- Teams toolkit & documentation
- Activity feed notifications option vs notification bot
	→ AF handy for handling responses and sending recipiant to the app through to notification
		is much more work than bot, but is more expansive and customizable than simple cards, as you can build up an entire interface
	→ Notification bot handy for handling requests and sending quick customizable cards to users through a chat message
		is much less work than AF noti's to get a decent result
- Azure API scope & permissions
- Microsoft Graph API needed for AF noti's

Roadblocks:
- Working to make react work with teams toolkit
- API scopes blocking progress
- Decision to fake AF noti's for demo's sake
- Still learning version control (git) and working as a team when developing
- Splitting research was difficult when we weren't sure what to research
